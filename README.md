# WindowTweak
AutoHotkey script for modifying the basic attributes of windows.

Use <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> to open the tweak menu, which will perform an action on the window that was under the mouse cursor at the moment you pressed the key.
Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> to re-run the last selected command on the window currently under the mouse cursor.
Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> to open a tweak menu that will act on the a window's individual control rather than the window itself. (advanced)

It is very easy to make a mess of your computer with this tool. **Use at your own risk.**
